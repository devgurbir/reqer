# Reqer
Reqer is a web application to support your API development. You can make GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests to any API URI. Reqer allows you to add as many request parameters & headers as you need. It also has the capability to add request body as JSON, XML, plain text, html and a few other options. 

The result will be shown in nicely-formatted + prettified JSON. You also have the choice to view the raw response along with the list of response headers.

Here are a few screenshots showing different parts of the app.
